# Regression Models

Build regression models to predict the total number of bike rentals in an hour for the dataset bikeRentalHourlyTrain.csv. This dataset includes a header row. 

Build models using neural networks, linear regression, and K Nearest Neighbours.  

The script reads in the entire file, but only uses relevant columns in the model. Information about the columns is contained in the file bikeSharingDataset.names.

Create and train the models (one for each technique), print out the training MSE, and then read in the bikeRentalHourlyTest.csv file, predict your results, and output the test MSE (for each of the three techniques). Use 5-fold cross validation.
