# Classification models

This project is to learn to use different classification models like Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine and K Nearest Neighbours. It runs all three models on the same training data and see which model is better at predicting the test data.
Accuracy and confusion matrix is printed out for each model.

The column names and their descriptions are included in the file adult.names. The data file adultTrain.data does not have a header row.
