# Classification models

This project is to learn to use different classification models like Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine and K Nearest Neighbours. It classifies people into two annual income groups - >50k and <=50k. A number of factors like age, work class, sex, race, education, occupation, native country, etc. are considered to build this classifier. It runs all three models on the same training data and see which model is better at predicting the test data. 

It is observed that all methods perform almost equally well, and SVM in fact is slightly better than the other two. Accuracy and confusion matrix is printed out for each model.

The column names and their descriptions are included in the file adult.names. The data file adultTrain.data does not have a header row.
