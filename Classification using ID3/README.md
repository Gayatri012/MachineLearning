# Classification using Decision Trees

carTrainData contains sample of car evaluations. The attributes measure the following:

buying price:   vhigh, high, med, low.
maint cost:    vhigh, high, med, low.
doors:    2, 3, 4, 5more.
persons:  2, 4, more.
lug_boot: small, med, big.
safety:   low, med, high.

The classifier will predict the values of the last attribute: unacc, acc, good, vgood based on the decision tree model trained using train data. The categorical data was converted to dummy variables before training the model.
